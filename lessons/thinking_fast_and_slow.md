### System 1 and System 2
- **System 1:** This system operates automatically, making quick decisions based on intuition. For example, when you easily recognize the emotion on a friend's face as happiness, this is System 1 at work. It's fast and efficient but can lead to errors in judgment.
- **System 2:** This system is more deliberate and logical, kicking in when you're solving a complex math problem or making a conscious effort to evaluate a decision. System 2 requires more energy and is slower but more accurate.

### Heuristics and Biases
- **Anchoring Effect:** In negotiations, the first price set can significantly influence the entire negotiation, even if it's arbitrarily high or low. For instance, if a seller starts with a very high price, the final price may be higher than if the seller had started with a lower initial price, regardless of the item's value.
- **Availability Heuristic:** After reading news reports about airplane crashes, you might overestimate the risk of flying. The vividness and emotional impact of the reports make such events more memorable, thus seemingly more frequent.
- **Substitution:** When asked how happy you are with your life, you might substitute this complex question with a simpler one: "Am I happy right now?" Your current mood could unduly influence your assessment of your overall happiness.
- **Overconfidence Bias:** A common example is when 90% of drivers believe they are better than the average driver, a statistical impossibility. This bias can lead to risky behaviors on the road because drivers overestimate their driving skills.
- **Confirmation Bias:** If you believe that left-handed people are more creative, you might pay more attention to instances that confirm this belief while ignoring examples that contradict it.
- **Endowment Effect:** If you own a coffee mug, you might value it more highly simply because it's yours, demanding a higher price to sell it than you would be willing to pay to buy it, even if it's identical to others available for sale.

### Prospect Theory
- **Loss Aversion:** Consider the pain you feel from losing $50 to be much more intense than the pleasure you feel from gaining $50. This asymmetry can lead people to avoid risks that might lead to losses, even when there is a potential for beneficial gains.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Imagine continuing to invest in a project because you've already spent a lot of money on it, even though continuing would lead to further losses. The initial investment influences decisions, leading to potentially irrational behavior to "not waste the initial investment," despite no recovery of the sunk costs.

### Overcoming Bias
To combat biases and make better decisions, Kahneman suggests:
- **Statistical thinking:** Before jumping to conclusions about a correlation (like a new health trend), look at the broader data and statistics to understand if there's a true effect or just anecdotal evidence.
- **Pre-mortem analysis:** By imagining a project has failed and then analyzing potential reasons for the failure, teams can identify and mitigate risks at the outset. For instance, before launching a new product, a team might envision scenarios that could lead to its failure, such as market competition or customer preferences, and take steps to address these issues in advance.

### Daniel Kahneman's Experiments
1. **The Linda Problem (Conjunction Fallacy)**
   - **Experiment:** Participants were given a description of Linda, a 31-year-old, single, outspoken, and very bright woman who majored in philosophy and was concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice. They were then asked to rate the probability of several statements about Linda, including whether she was a bank teller or a bank teller and active in the feminist movement.
   - **Result:** The majority of participants judged it more probable that Linda was both a bank teller and active in the feminist movement than that she was a bank teller only, illustrating the conjunction fallacy.

2. **Framing Effects (Asian Disease Problem)**
   - **Experiment:** Participants were presented with a scenario involving a disease outbreak expected to kill 600 people and were given two different programs to choose from to combat the outbreak.
   - **Result:** Participants' choices were significantly influenced by how the options were framed, demonstrating how decision-making can be manipulated by framing effects.

3. **Anchoring**
   - **Experiment:** Participants were asked to estimate the percentage of African nations in the United Nations after spinning a wheel of fortune that stopped on either 10 or 65.
   - **Result:** The spin significantly influenced the estimates, showing the power of the anchoring effect.

4. **Prospect Theory**
   - **Experiment:** People were asked to make choices between certain and probabilistic alternatives regarding gains and losses.
   - **Result:** They found that people are risk-averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses, leading to the development of Prospect Theory.

5. **Endowment Effect**
   - **Experiment:** Participants were given a mug and then offered the chance to sell it or trade it for an equivalent value pen.
   - **Result:** Kahneman found that ownership increases the value people assign to items, demonstrating the endowment effect.

6. **Loss Aversion**
   - **Experiment:** Demonstrated through various experiments, including gambling scenarios where participants had to choose between sure losses and probabilistic ones.
   - **Result:** People are typically more sensitive to losses than to gains of the same magnitude.

7. **Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases**
   - **Experiment:** Examined how people make judgments under uncertain conditions.
   - **Result:** Found that heuristics lead to systematic biases in predictions and evaluations.

8. **Overconfidence Bias**
   - **Experiment:** Participants were asked to answer questions and to indicate their confidence in their answers.
   - **Result:** People tend to overestimate their knowledge and abilities.

9. **The Simulation Heuristic**
   - **Experiment:** Explored how people predict the likelihood of future events.
   - **Result:** Events that are easier to imagine are perceived as more likely.

10. **Theory of Mental Accounting**
    - **Experiment:** Investigated how people categorize, process, and evaluate economic outcomes.
    - **Result:** Individuals segregate money into different accounts, leading to irrational financial decisions.
